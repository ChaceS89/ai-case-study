# Transforming Medicine with AI

## Overview and Origin
Tempus is an innovative company that was established in 2015 by Eric Lefkofsky with the aim of helping people overcome cancer through the use of advanced technology such as data analysis. The reason for Tempus's emergence was Lefkofsky, with his own life experience and the death of a close family member due to cancer, which brought the need for precision oncology and the use of the large amounts of data gathered during treatment (Carron, 2024). Given that AI can bring such massive changes to the healthcare industry, Lefkofsky and the other founders of Tempus aim to create the best team to achieve the goal of helping many patients by using the strength of data. Although just starting, Tempus has attracted quite significant capital: for example, in September 2024, it received $100 million in funding from Revolution Growth, New Enterprise Associates, and T Rowe Price to achieve its large-scale objectives (Bekbolatova et al., 2024).
The company's business model focuses on the utilization of genomic sequencing, precise data, and healthcare data curation and also integrating innovative machine learning algorithms to help oncologists and health care givers (Sasser, 2023). Tempus builds one of the world's largest libraries of clinical and molecular data and allows physicians to introduce info meant to complement the cancer patient's genetic blueprint. This not only increases the accuracy of the treatment process focused on cancer but expands the speed of identifying new treatments based on individual characteristics, placing Tempus at the forefront of developing precision medicine (Alaskar et al., 2022).

Tempus employs other technologies in its operations like machine learning algorithms, natural language processing, and next-generation sequencing. Tempus uses machine learning techniques to analyze complex data and look for connections between the information and more significant patterns, enabling the discovery of new biomarkers, as well as the prognosis of outcomes based on the treatment administered. 
## Landscape

* What field is the company in?
Tempus is a company that delivers its services in the healthcare and medical technology industry with an emphasis on oncology and precision medicine. 
* What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years?
Some of the major trends common in this area consist of the shift towards the development of a precision medicine approach that aims at delivering an individualized patient treatment based on their genomic map and medical information. 
Advanced molecular techniques have made it cheaper to conduct genomic sequencing and, hence, more detailed and selective diagnostics and treatment plans.
Similarly, the application of AI as an aid in the decision-making process of doctors has made it possible for healthcare providers to design and implement robust and accurate analyses of their patients, thus leading to recommended treatments for the patient's needs. 
* What are the other major companies in this field?
The industry involves major players like IBM Watson Health, Foundation Medicine, and Guardant Health, which are helping in enhancing AI-based solutions in the healthcare sector. 
## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
Tempus has made tremendous progress in helping patients by using AI and has had a substantial impact on the oncology industry. The benefit that can be assessed about the company is the fact that it assists oncologists in producing fairly accurate recommendations for treatment, which makes a lot of sense in view of customer needs
* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?
Evaluation benchmarks in this discipline are survival figures of patients, response rates to treatment, and how well the models developed forecast results. Tempus also significantly compares well on these targets, as it surpasses the industry average by recording higher numbers that can be considered best practices in the field of precision medicine.
* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?
Nonetheless, Tempus's benchmark model of combining the extensive genomic database with clinicians' insights places it at the forefront of AI-driven healthcare companies. This progression showcases the company's continued dedication to enhancing patient care and emphasizes its impact on the development and understanding of precision medicine 
## Recommendations

# Transforming Medicine with AI

## Overview and Origin
Tempus is an innovative company that was established in 2015 by Eric Lefkofsky with the aim of helping people overcome cancer through the use of advanced technology such as data analysis. The reason for Tempus's emergence was Lefkofsky, with his own life experience and the death of a close family member due to cancer, which brought the need for precision oncology and the use of the large amounts of data gathered during treatment (Carron, 2024). Given that AI can bring such massive changes to the healthcare industry, Lefkofsky and the other founders of Tempus aim to create the best team to achieve the goal of helping many patients by using the strength of data. Although just starting, Tempus has attracted quite significant capital: for example, in September 2024, it received $100 million in funding from Revolution Growth, New Enterprise Associates, and T Rowe Price to achieve its large-scale objectives (Bekbolatova et al., 2024).
The company's business model focuses on the utilization of genomic sequencing, precise data, and healthcare data curation and also integrating innovative machine learning algorithms to help oncologists and health care givers (Sasser, 2023). Tempus builds one of the world's largest libraries of clinical and molecular data and allows physicians to introduce info meant to complement the cancer patient's genetic blueprint. This not only increases the accuracy of the treatment process focused on cancer but expands the speed of identifying new treatments based on individual characteristics, placing Tempus at the forefront of developing precision medicine (Alaskar et al., 2022).
